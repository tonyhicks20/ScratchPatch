    <Description>A scratch patch is a South African term for an area of semi-precious rocks that you dig around and fill a bag with whatever looks appealing to you. This project aims to be a similar idea. I hope to bundle some code in here that I've written based on work experience and have found useful across many business domains.</Description>
